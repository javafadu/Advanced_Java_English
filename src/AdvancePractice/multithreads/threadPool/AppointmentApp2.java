package AdvancePractice.multithreads.threadPool;

/*
NOTES:
    - Working with thread is expensive, each thread requires / needs sources on the system
    - These sources are CPU, RAM, etc.
    - We can optimize and limit using threads for source efficiency

    *****
    For above reason, we can create a thread pool with limited capacity,
    we can fill these thread pool with created threads which are already created before and ready to use
    -> This way provides us more performance with less sources (efficiency)
